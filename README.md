# ðŸš¢ Collision Course Detection from Images 
This project detects whether two ships (represented by objects in a scene) are on a collision course â€” by analyzing a sequence of images taken from a fixed camera.

## Motivation
Inspired by maritime safety applications, this project demonstrates how computer vision techniques can be used to:
- Rectify image perspective
- Track object positions across frames
- Analyze geometry (distance and angle)
- Predict future collision based on motion trends

The project puts into practice topics covered in the course such as:
- Perspective warping
- Manual and automatic feature localization
- Geometric reasoning (distance, angle over time)
- Visualization and analysis

## ðŸ›  How It Works
1. **Perspective Rectification**  
   The user selects 4 points in one image to warp all frames to a consistent top-down view.

2. **Manual Object Center Selection**  
   For each frame in a scene, the user clicks on the centers of the two ships (or shoes!).

3. **Geometric Analysis**  
   The program computes:
   - Distance between ships in each frame
   - Relative angle between them
   - Trend of distance and angle over time

4. **Collision Prediction**  
   If the angle remains consistent and distance decreases steadily, the program flags a collision course.
