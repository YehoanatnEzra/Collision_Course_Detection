# CollisionVision

Final project for the 3D Vision course â€“ Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

This project simulates a known nautical technique for predicting **collision course** between two ships.  
The method relies on checking whether another ship stays at a constant bearing (angle) in a sequence of images.
